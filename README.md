# JavaScript Data Structure

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/almandsky/js-data-structure.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/almandsky/js-data-structure)

The code here is copying from https://github.com/loiane/javascript-datastructures-algorithms, and the purpose is to make it easier to reference without the folder structure of the book chapter.

I am also rewriting it by using the node js to execute the example, and will also try to make some improvement on the implementation.

## How to run the code

```bash
node ./lib-exec/usingGraph.js
```

## How to run the test

```bash
npm install;
npm test;
```
