# JavaScript Data Structure

The code here is copying from https://github.com/loiane/javascript-datastructures-algorithms, and the purpose is to make it easier to reference without the folder structure of the book chapter.

I am also rewriting it by using the node js to execute the example, and will also try to make some improvement on the implementation.

## How to run the code

`node usingGraph.js`
